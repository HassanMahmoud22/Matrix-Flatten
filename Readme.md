# Matrix Flatten

## About

A 3D matrix is to be stored in a 1D vector (flattened).

The 3D matrix is of size n x m x p and is indexed by i, j, k.

The 1D vector is of size q and is indexed by y.

## Description

It has two main functions

1. Create a 1D vector suitable for storing the 3D matrix.
2. Convert the 3D matrix index (i, j, k) to a suitable 1D vector index (y). in O(1).
